# Aim:
To simulate and synthesis encoder8to3 using Vivado 2023.2.
# Apparatus Required:
Vivado 2023.2
# Procedure:
1. Open Vivado: Launch Xilinx Vivado software on your computer.

2. Create a New Project: Click on "Create Project" from the welcome page or navigate through "File" > "Project" > "New".

3. Project Settings: Follow the prompts to set up your project. Specify the project name, location, and select RTL project type.

4. Add Design Files: Add your Verilog design files to the project. You can do this by right-clicking on "Design Sources" in the Sources window, then selecting "Add Sources". Choose your Verilog files from the file browser.

5. Specify Simulation Settings: Go to "Simulation" > "Simulation Settings". Choose your simulation language (Verilog in this case) and simulation tool (Vivado Simulator).

6. Run Simulation: Go to "Flow" > "Run Simulation" > "Run Behavioral Simulation". This will launch the Vivado Simulator and compile your design for simulation.

7. Set Simulation Time: In the Vivado Simulator window, set the simulation time if it's not set automatically. This determines how long the simulation will run.

8. Run Simulation: Start the simulation by clicking on the "Run" button in the simulation window.

9. View Results: After the simulation completes, you can view waveforms, debug signals, and analyze the behavior of your design.

# Program
```
module encoder_8 8(d,a,b,c) ;
input [7:0]d;
output a,b,c;
or(a,d[4],d[5],d[6],d[7])
or(b,d[2],d[3],d[6],d[7]);
or(c,d[1],d[3],d[5],d[7])
endmodule
```
# Output
![encoder](https://github.com/j-gugan/ENCODER8TO3/assets/163828735/11b71e80-6319-4778-9cc0-d0bd938f7535)
# Result:
Thus,Encoder8to3 using Vivado 2023.2 is  simulated and synthesised.
